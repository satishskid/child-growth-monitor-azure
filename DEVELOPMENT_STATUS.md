- ✅ Minimal dependencies installed (FastAPI, Uvicorn, PIL, numpy)
- ✅ Mock ML service running with anthropometric analysis
- ✅ Health endpoint responding: `http://localhost:8002/health`
- ✅ Analysis endpoint functional: `/analyze` with image upload
- ✅ Model status endpoint: `/models/status`

### 3. Integration Testing
- ✅ Services communication verified
- ✅ ML analysis working with test images
- ✅ Mock predictions returning realistic child growth data
- ✅ Backend and ML service health checks passing

## 🔧 Service Status

| Service | Port | Status | URL |
|---------|------|--------|-----|
| Backend API | 5002 | ✅ Running | http://localhost:5002 |
| ML Service | 8002 | ✅ Running | http://localhost:8002 |
| Mobile App | 8081 | ⚠️ File watching issue | Partially working |

## 🔄 How to Restart Services

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
export PORT=5002
python app.py
```

### ML Service
```bash
cd ml-service
source venv/bin/activate
export PORT=8002
python main_minimal.py
```

## 📱 Mobile App Issue & Solutions

The mobile app has a file watching issue (EMFILE: too many open files) which is common on macOS. Here are solutions:

### Option 1: Use Expo Go App (Recommended)
1. Install Expo Go from App Store (iOS) or Play Store (Android)
2. Try starting the app with reduced file watching:
   ```bash
   cd mobile-app
   WATCHMAN_DISABLE_FILE_WATCH=1 npm start
   ```
3. Scan the QR code that appears with Expo Go

### Option 2: Increase System Limits
```bash
# Temporarily increase file descriptor limit
ulimit -n 65536

# Then start the app
cd mobile-app
npm start
```

### Option 3: Use Web Version
```bash
cd mobile-app
npm run web
```

## 🧪 Testing the System

Run the integration test:
```bash
python test_integration.py
```

Expected output:
- ✅ Backend health check
- ✅ ML service health check  
- ✅ ML analysis with test image
- ✅ Model status verification

## 🎯 Next Development Steps

1. **Fix mobile app file watching** - Try the solutions above
2. **Add authentication** - Backend user login/registration endpoints working
3. **Implement real ML models** - Replace mock predictions with actual computer vision models
4. **Add data persistence** - Store scan results and child data
5. **Connect mobile to services** - Configure API endpoints in mobile app
6. **Add offline support** - Implement local data storage and sync

## 📊 Mock Data Available

The ML service currently returns realistic mock data for:
- Height predictions (age-based)
- Weight estimations  
- MUAC (Mid-Upper Arm Circumference)
- WHO Z-scores for growth assessment
- Nutritional status classification

## 🔗 API Endpoints Available

### Backend (Port 5002)
- `GET /health` - Service health check
- `GET /` - Service info and available endpoints

### ML Service (Port 8002)  
- `GET /health` - Service health check
- `POST /analyze` - Analyze uploaded image for anthropometric measurements
- `GET /models/status` - Check ML model status
- `POST /analyze/batch` - Batch analysis endpoint

## 🚀 Ready for Development!

Both backend and ML services are running and responding correctly. The mobile app can be started with the workarounds above. The system is ready for continued development and testing!
