## ü§ù Contributing

The project is designed for open source contribution:
- **Clear Architecture**: Well-documented modular design
- **Development Tools**: VS Code tasks, automated setup, type safety
- **Testing Framework**: Unit and integration test structure ready
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for developers and users
- **Ethical Foundation**: Privacy-first, child-safety focused design

## üìù Technical Debt & Known Issues

### To Address
1. **Type Errors**: Some TypeScript errors need resolution (imports mainly)
2. **Real Training Data**: Need actual training dataset for ML models
3. **Performance Testing**: Load testing for concurrent users
4. **Mobile Optimization**: Battery usage and processing optimization
5. **Error Handling**: More robust error handling and user feedback

### Design Decisions
- **SQLite for Dev**: Easy setup, PostgreSQL for production
- **Mock ML Models**: Allows development without training data
- **Expo Framework**: Rapid development vs native performance tradeoff
- **Microservices**: Complexity vs scalability and maintainability

This foundation provides a solid base for building a production-ready child malnutrition screening system that can make a real impact on global health outcomes. The architecture is designed to scale from individual clinics to national health systems while maintaining the highest standards for child data protection and privacy.
